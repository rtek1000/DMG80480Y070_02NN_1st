# DWIN DMG80480Y070_02NN
First impressions of the Dwin display model DMG80480Y070_02NN and Basic commands

If you are looking for a low-cost display and are targeting an [SSD1963](https://github.com/rtek1000/Display_TFT_800x480_7_inch_SSD1963), it might be interesting to check out Dwin displays.

- Compared to the SSD1963 display module, this Dwin display module has a good performance, as the microcontroller only needs to send data to set a memory address (called VP, 16-bits) for an icon to appear on the screen. While for an icon to appear on the screen, or to remove it, using the SSD1963, it will be necessary for the microcontroller to send all the icon data.

- [Danger: high voltage for ESP32 and others below 5V](https://github.com/dwinhmi/DWIN_DGUS_HMI/issues/17)
- - The DMG80480Y070_02NN display is releasing 5V at output TX2.
- - Datasheet says: TX2 output 3.2V, but my ESP32 started receiving data from the display intermittently.

## Flash memory

I found a W25Q128 memory on this Dwin display (and a T5L0 IC). The data is saved in this memory in virtual partitions of 256kB, so it might be interesting for the ESP32 (or other uC) to program the data from the W25Q128 memory, which is SPI. The file number is saved in each virtual partition, for example file 32.* must be saved in position 32x256kB. Indeed, the files are stored exactly as they were generated by the DGUS2 software.

For example, the file 0_DWIN_ASC.HZK starts at address 0x00 of the W25Q128. A 14 file must start at address 14x(1024x256) = 14x(262144) = 3670016; in hexadecimal it is 380000h or 0x380000. With the [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/) program it is possible to see the binary files, although it is not possible to decompile, you can already notice the data pattern. And you can also adjust the offset for the address, for example 0x380000 and see the contents of file 14.

If the RESET of the IC T5L0 leaves the pins in a high impedance state (HIGH-Z), then it may be interesting to have a buffer, just to prevent the ESP32 from interfering with the T5L's SPI bus. For example, the [TXU0304](https://www.ti.com/product/TXU0304) buffer, which can be used for the SPI bus and others. So, when the activated buffer for the ESP32 has access to the W25Q128 memory, the RESET of IC T5L0 would also be triggered, leaving the W25Q128 memory free for the ESP32 to access.

Once the ESP32 has access to the W25Q128 of the Dwin display, it would be possible to remotely update the display files, as the ESP32 has the ability to access the Internet, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network.

## Capacitive touchscreen

Regarding the possibility of installing a capacitive touchscreen on this display model, Dwin said it is not possible. Checking the board we can see that the pins that are dedicated for communication via I2C seem to not have tracks connected to the IC T5L0 pins. And as the pins are very narrow and very close together (Pitch 0.4mm), it must be difficult to adapt wires to this board.

Note: The Arduino (ESP32) can handle the Capacitive Touchscreen controller model GSL1680, see the library [here](https://github.com/rtek1000/GSL1680_). The GSL1680 is listed in the touchscreen options in the CFG file settings tab. It is more advantageous to operate the touchscreen via Arduino (UNO, ESP32 etc), in case long periods of display inactivity are necessary, this way the touchscreen can continue working and serve to wake up the screen (when in fact the screen has the power supply (12V) turned off).

## Resistive touchscreen

Support for Resistive Touchscreen is on the board, it may be necessary to check the datasheet of the model with the touchscreen (DMG80480Y070_02NR) to see if there is a difference in the programming of the T5LCFG.CFG file.

## Display model supported by the board

The display model is LN80480C070, but I didn't find this display on the internet. Comparing with the display present in the module with the SSD1963 controller, I noticed that the LN80480C070 pins are compatible with the AT070TN92-V.X display, including the flat cable appears to be the same, and the image is practically the same, the fitting is also 50-way . So, if necessary, it may be possible to adapt another display model to this board with T5L0 IC.
